# Weighted graph
This project focuses on building a module of an undirectional, weighted graph.
It produces the following Algorithms:
1) Builds a Graph.
2) Create deep and shallow copy of Graph.
3) Check if all nodes of Graph are connected.
4) Calculate the shortest route from one node to another.
5) Return list of the shortest route between 2 nodes.
6) Save, Load functions, and Tests. 

* This project is done as part of a University assignment. for "Object-oriented programming" 
class, at Ariel university, Israel.
